<span style="text-align: left;">Whilst looking for videos to use in class I stumbled across this section of the Big Bang Theory that analogues historical physics teaching so perfectly that I had to share it. Sheldon, despite all his passion for the subject and knowledge of it's history cannot engage Penny, because she has a different set of interests and targets in mind...</span></div>

<span style="text-align: left;">I am sure that this is many people's experience of the subject - a dry and mathematically demanding subject, of little&nbsp;</span><span style="text-align: left;">relevance</span><span style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;to what interests them. &nbsp;</span>At one point Sheldon even falls into&nbsp;the "taught my dog to whistle" trap when he exclaims&nbsp;<span style="text-align: center;">"How can you not know - I just told you!?"&nbsp;</span>In the end she regurgitates a very impressive description, obviously learnt by rote, but shows no understanding, save for the history of the fig roll.&nbsp;The&nbsp;parallels with students learning how to jump through hoops in exams, quoting formulae and cranking numbers without proper understanding are again striking.</div>

Into the mixture we now throw two interesting articles from the BBC, both reporting on research carried out in education. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-17854008" target="_blank">The first</a>&nbsp;comments on the Nuffield foundation reports findings - that the mathematics is leaching out of science,&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-17913649" target="_blank">the second </a>recounts demands by students who want to learn maths but struggle with abstract examples.<br />
Students <i>want</i>&nbsp;a mathematical ability with practical application. Physics provides this but suffers from image from old school teaching.<br />
<br />
So I guess this is where <i style="font-weight: bold;">we</i>&nbsp;come in, the teachers, we have to continue to work hard to develop our practice through using things like assessment for learning and current technologies to deliver a&nbsp;relevant, interesting, mathematically inclusive course - remembering all the time to differentiate enough to make it work for the Pennys <i>and </i>the Sheldons of the future.<br />
<br />
My own approach to solving this task is to combine the&nbsp;enthusiasm of Sheldon, relevance, the ideas of accelerated learning, and finally AfL, into something that maps out like this;<br />
